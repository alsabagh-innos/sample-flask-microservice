# Sample Flask Microservice
This is a sample Flask microservice that can be used as a starting point for a new project. It includes a basic Flask app with a single endpoint that returns a JSON response.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies using pipenv.

```bash
git clone
cd sample-flask-microservice
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Flask app using the following command:

```bash
python run.py
```

The app will start on port 5000 by default, and you can access the single endpoint at http://localhost:5000/

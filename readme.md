# Sample Flask Microservice
This is a sample Flask microservice that can be used as a starting point for a new project. It includes a basic Flask app with a single endpoint that returns a JSON response.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies using pipenv.

```bash
git clone
cd sample-flask-microservice
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Flask app using the following command:

```bash
python run.py
```

The app will start on port 5000 by default, and you can access the single endpoint at http://localhost:5000/

# Features

1. **Web Application**: The presence of Flask suggests that this is a web application. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.

2. **API Development**: The inclusion of Flask-JWT-Extended indicates that the application might be using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, which is common in API development.

3. **Database Interaction**: Libraries like Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-PyMongo, and psycopg2-binary suggest that the application interacts with databases, possibly both SQL (like PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (like MongoDB).

4. **Task Queue**: The presence of Celery and its related libraries (like amqp, kombu, and billiard) suggests that the application might be using a task queue for asynchronous tasks.

5. **Data Processing**: The inclusion of pandas and numpy indicates that the application might be performing some data processing or analysis.

6. **Testing**: The presence of pytest and pytest-flask suggests that the application has unit tests, possibly for the Flask routes.

7. **Environment Variables**: The use of python-dotenv indicates that the application uses environment variables, likely for configuration settings.

8. **HTTP Requests**: The presence of requests and httpx libraries suggests that the application might be making HTTP requests to other services.

9. **AWS Services**: The inclusion of boto3 and s3transfer indicates that the application might be interacting with AWS services, possibly for storage (S3) or other cloud-based operations.

10. **Task Scheduling**: The presence of APScheduler suggests that the application might be scheduling tasks to run at specific times or intervals.
